    "## Model Export Framework for PLC Deployment  \n",
    "\n",
    "This module is developed as part of the research project:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_“Towards AI-Based Anomaly Detection at the Edge:  \n",
    "Evaluating Real-Time Cyber Defense in Programmable Logic Controllers”_**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation establishes a deterministic and reproducible framework for deploying LSTM-based anomaly detection models on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in research and educational contexts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It enables consistent model loading from PyTorch checkpoints through a parameter-aligned interface that supports both full model serialization and `state_dict` checkpoints.  \n",
    "All LSTM parameters — including input and recurrent weights, biases, and fully connected layer coefficients — are extracted per gate (`i, f, g, o`) and converted into PLC-native data structures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two standardized export formats are produced:  \n",
    "- **Siemens DATA_BLOCK (`.db`)** – for Siemens© PLC 'db' variable initialization.  \n",
    "- **Structured Text (`.st`)** – for for Beckhoff© PLC 'st' variable initialization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The framework includes a user-confirmed overwrite mechanism for safe file handling and employs a hyperparameter-based naming convention to ensure traceability between the original neural network and its PLC-deployable form.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism constitutes a core technical component of the above-mentioned research, supporting AI-based anomaly detection at the industrial edge and enabling real-time, resource-efficient, and auditable cyber defense in critical automation systems.  \n",

    "## User Guide — Configuration and Execution  \n",
    "\n",
    "This module automatically locates and exports the correct trained LSTM model based on a minimal configuration defined at the beginning of the script.  \n",
    "The user only needs to configure a few parameters; all paths and exports are handled automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Configure Model Parameters  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the script, set these constants according to the trained model you want to export:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MODEL_NAME = \"LSTM_SWaT\"\n",
    "MODEL_VERSION = \"v1\"\n",
    "HIDDEN_SIZE = 8\n",
    "SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 10\n",
    "BEST_EPOCH = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Run the Script  \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the notebook or script manually (no need for “Run All”).  \n",
    "Confirm overwrite if prompted.  \n",
    "No additional user action is required — the export files will be created automatically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Check the Output  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After completion, verify that the following files exist in the model folder:\n",
    "The exact filenames depend on the user-defined configuration parameters\n",
    "(e.g., model name, hidden size, input window, version, and epoch).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output files:\n",
    "- `LSTM_SWaT_HS8_IW10_v1_Epoch_02.db`\n",
    "- `LSTM_SWaT_HS8_IW10_v1_Epoch_02.st`\n",
    "\n",
    "These represent the PLC-ready exports of your trained model.  \n",
